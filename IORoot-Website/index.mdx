##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project

IORoot.com is a simple gatsby instance that works with MDX. 

It has two sources of data:

1. The `blog` repository.
2. The `projects` folder within this repository.

The `blog` repository it built through two methods. 

Firstly, there are manually create posted (numbered from 001 onwards). These contitute the blog posts on the homepage.

Secondly, that repository has a github action that scrapes all of my other github repositories for their `README.md` files. These become all of the projects.

There is a simple frontmatter at the top of each MDX file that is then rendered with the logo/colour of that project. 

The logo comes from materialicons and simpleicons.com.

This also uses Tailwind for styling.

Hosted on Netlify.
