# wp-plugin__auto-menu
Adds posts of a selected category to a menu automatically.

Cool little plugin that appears on the admin menu page. Allows you to select a post category and will automatically add any posts in that category to the menu.

Used on londonparkour.com for the wiki. Any posts in the 'wiki' specific category will be added straight to the 'wiki' menu that is on the sidebar of the wiki pages.
