# The lead...

So, my first little project is going to scrape a bunch of repos / websites for the latest version
of their product. 

The site will display those latest versions and update every day. It's a single source of truth for
a large range of products. It also doesn't have to be limited to software either...

The initial plan is to get the latest versions of these categories:
- Operating Systems
- Browsers
- IDEs

Then we'll build from there.
