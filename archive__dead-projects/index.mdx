# archive__dead-projects

This is where all the repos, code and projects I've written over the years that I no longer use lives.

## Usage:

1. Clone this project.
2. Clone the dead project into it.
3. Push the changes up to this repo.
4. Delete github repo of dead project.
5. Delete local copies of both dead project and this repo.
