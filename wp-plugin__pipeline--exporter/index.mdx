##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project

The pipeline project was built to automatically build, process and export generated posts. This plugin is that last part of the process. The exporter connects with various endpoints and APIs to send those generated posts to.

Originally I wanted all social media, but eventually whittled it down to YouTube, Google-My-Business, Trello, Creator Studio and REST Endpoints.

###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With

This project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.

* [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [PHP](https://php.net/)
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)

You will need the following extra plugins to work:

- HTTPS Must be working on the site / vagrant
- [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)
- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--YouTube](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--YouTube)
- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--GMB](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--GMB)

These plugins will allow you to do an OAUTH connection to the specific service. They are ACF buttons that will complete the hand-shake 
with the google APIs.

Thee following plugin will make the code boxes look better.

##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

###  3.1. <a name='StepsbeforeactivatingAUTHplugins'></a>Steps before activating AUTH plugins

1. Make sure you do a `composer install` or `composer update` in each before activating 
1. Also, make sure the `client_secret.json` file is placed in the root of each OAUTH plugin. (See below)

There is a .gitignore on the file `client_secret.json`, so you don't commit it to a repo by accident.

###  3.2. <a name='Check'></a>Check

If the auth plugins are working, you will see a new 'LOGIN WITH YOUTUBE' button on authentication tab on the exporter plugin for youtube.

###  3.3. <a name='GoogleMyBusiness'></a>Google My Business

Is one of the only client-libraries that is NOT part of the standard `google/apiclient-services`, so you have to download it yourself.
You can get it here: https://developers.google.com/my-business/samples/previousVersions

Place it into the `/GMB` folder.

###  3.4. <a name='OAUTHKeys'></a>OAUTH Keys

Head over the the google console https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a project with the following APIs:

- YouTube Data API v3
- Google My Business

The google my business API is a private one and you need to request access from google for it.

Create an OAUTH 2.0 client ID and download the `client_secret.json` file: place it into the root of the plugin.

###  5.1. <a name='OAUTHIssues'></a>OAUTH Issues


1. Ensure HTTPS is working. (Make sure cert is created and added to keychain)


2. Ensure the address of the `Authorised redirect URIs` has the correct URIs in it's list.
```
https://dev.exporter.londonparkour.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
```
Preferably at the top of the list.

3. Ensure `Authorised JavaScript origins` in the google console APIs 'credentials' has your correct domain. 
domain:
e.g.
```
https://dev.exporter.londonparkour.com
```
