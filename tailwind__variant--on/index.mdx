This simple tailwind plugin will define 20 new variants that make it simple to select the Xth child, every Y children.

Simple use-case: 

You have a flexbox with three children (33%) of the width. There are many children all on `flex-wrap`.

You want to change the background to red on the second child on each row.

Well, you can use the variant `on-2/3:bg-red-300`.

###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With

This project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

###  2.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

Within your tailwind.config.js, do these steps:

1. `require()` the tailwind-on.js file in this repo.
2. add which utility you want the variant added to. (Remember you need to escape the backslash with a forward-slash.)
3. Remember to recompile your stylesheet using `postcss` 


```
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin');

module.exports = {

  plugins: [
    require('./plugins/tailwind-on'),
  ],

  variants: {
    extend: {
      margin: ['on-2\/3'],
    },
  },

}
```


By adding many variants, your CSS file will grow very large. Make sure you are only using the ones you need and make sure you
purge any CSS too.
