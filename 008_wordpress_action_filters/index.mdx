# Wordpress Simple Actions & Filters


Curse the gods, this simple functionality can seem complicated. I think its a combination of the terminology and word choice being so unhelpful. Do I `add` , `apply` or `do` a filter or action? What is a hook here? Or maybe I need to register it? It's all very vague, and I constantly forget.

Anyway, here's some pretty pictures instead. I've made it as basic as possible, more for remembering which one to use and where.

## 🧗🏻‍♀️ Basic Actions

TL; DR : Plug in new code at a specific point.

1.  Once you've registered your code, you're now 'hooked' into the action `'do_something_here'`  
    
2.  Whenever the code gets to the `do_action('do_something_here')`, it'll now run your function `'run_action_function'`.  
    
3.  No need to return anything.

## 🔍 Basic Filters

TL;DR : Pass in a value, change the value, pass new value back.

1.  Once you've registered your code, you're now 'hooked' into the filter `'do_something_here'`.
2.  Whenever the code gets to the `add_filter('run_a_filter_on')`, it'll now run your function `'run_filter_function'`.
3.  Pass the old value `$value` into the function.
4.  MUST return something (the new value).

## Closing.

Filters and actions have more arguments to them and are very versatile.
