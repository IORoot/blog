# HouseQuests Application

This is the official public repository for the HouseQuests Application. 

You can browse and download prior releases of the application as well as submit issues or enhancement suggestions.



## Reality of the project

Housequests is a small little side-project that I wanted to make available to the public for a small fee. As much as I'd want to support and bug-fix this application, Its not feasible for me to be able to commit to that. So this github repo is for people to communicate through the issues page and help each other solve any problems. I'll comment when I can. 


## Issues

Sign up for a github account and submit your issues through the 'issues' tab (see above) on this page. 

When adding an issue, please try to add an appropriate label to categorise it.


## Wiki

The main wiki and documentation is on the website at [HouseQuests.com/docs](https://HouseQuests.com/docs). You can find decriptions and help for most features of the application there.


## Free first

Before you subscribe to the HouseQuests application, it's wise to just install the free version first and check that it's working. The subscription will give you a code to unlock the extra features on the same application - which means you won't loose any money if it doesn't work correctly.
